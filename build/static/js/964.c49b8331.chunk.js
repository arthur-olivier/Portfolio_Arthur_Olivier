My areas of interest and expertise lie in the fields of Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, and Computer Science. Currently, I am actively seeking a full-time job in the realm of Web/Mobile Development or Machine Learning.\n\n# Currently\n\nThroughout my time at Oregon State University, I have acquired valuable experience in collaborating with teams, managing projects, and fostering relationships with companies. My technical skills encompass a diverse range of technologies, including Python, React, and C++. While my primary focus is as a software engineer, my proficiency extends to various disciplines and technology stacks.\n\n\n# Some history\n\n- My passion for mathematics and computer science began during my college years. Immediately after obtaining my Baccalaur\xe9at degree, I enrolled in an engineering school where I was introduced to a wide range of subjects, such as electronics, optics, computer science, and robotics. During my third year of school, I decided to specialize in computer science, focusing primarily on big data and software design.\n\n- In 2021, I had the privilege of interning at Siemens France, where I gained more in-depth knowledge and appreciation for machine learning. This experience reinforced my belief in the importance of artificial intelligence in today's world. Additionally, I have a keen interest in web development and mobile applications, which is why I decided to specialize in machine learning and web/mobile development during my exchange program at Oregon State University.\n\n\n# Outside of Tech\n\n- In my spare time, I enjoy skateboarding, which I have been doing for over a decade, and I continue to pursue this passion whenever I can. I am also an avid music enthusiast and DJ, honing my mixing skills for the past two years.\n",d=l.split(/\s+/).map((function(e){return e.replace(/\W/g,"")})).filter((function(e){return e.length})).length,h=function(e){var n=Object.assign({},e);return(0,c.jsx)(t.rU,(0,a.Z)({},n))};n.default=function(){return(0,c.jsx)(s.Z,{title:"About",description:"Learn about Arthur OLIVIER ",children:(0,c.jsxs)("article",{className:"post markdown",id:"about",children:[(0,c.jsx)("header",{children:(0,c.jsxs)("div",{className:"title",children:[(0,c.jsx)("h2",{"data-testid":"heading",children:(0,c.jsx)(t.rU,{to:"/about",children:"About Me"})}),(0,c.jsxs)("p",{children:["(in about ",d," words)"]})]})}),(0,c.jsx)(o(),{source:l,renderers:{Link:h},escapeHtml:!1})]})})}}}]);
